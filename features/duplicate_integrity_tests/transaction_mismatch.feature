Feature: Detect Transaction Mismatches in Export Files
@transaction_mismatch @data_integrity @validation
Scenario Outline: Identify transactions with mismatched details
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I compare the "Transaction ID", "Amount", and "Currency" columns in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then transactions with mismatched details should be flagged
		And flagged transactions should be reviewed for potential data entry errors
		And a report should be generated listing mismatches
Examples:
| file_name                                    | sheet_name |
| bank_export_transaction_mismatch_test.csv  | N/A        |
| bank_export_transaction_mismatch_test.xlsx | Sheet1     |
@transaction_mismatch @edge_case @date_inconsistency
Scenario Outline: Detect transactions with mismatched dates
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the "Transaction ID" and "Date" columns in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then transactions with conflicting dates should be flagged
		And transactions with future-dated timestamps should trigger an alert
		And flagged records should be manually reviewed for correction
Examples:
| file_name                                          | sheet_name |
| bank_export_transaction_mismatch_date_conflict.csv | N/A        |
| bank_export_transaction_mismatch_date_conflict.xlsx | Sheet1     |
@transaction_mismatch @data_quality @amount_variance
Scenario Outline: Identify transactions with inconsistent amounts
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I compare the "Transaction ID" and "Amount" columns in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then transactions with different amounts in multiple records should be flagged
		And a system alert should be generated for financial reconciliation
		And flagged transactions should be reviewed for possible fraud
Examples:
| file_name                                             | sheet_name |
| bank_export_transaction_mismatch_amount_variance.csv  | N/A        |
| bank_export_transaction_mismatch_amount_variance.xlsx | Sheet1     |
@transaction_mismatch @edge_case @large_files @performance
Scenario Outline: Validate transaction mismatch detection in large datasets
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for transaction mismatches in a file with more than 100,000 rows
	Then all mismatched transactions should be detected efficiently
		And system performance should be benchmarked for optimization
		And flagged transaction mismatches should be logged for auditing
Examples:
| file_name                                     | sheet_name |
| bank_export_large_file_transaction_mismatch.csv | N/A        |
| bank_export_large_file_transaction_mismatch.xlsx | Sheet1     |
@transaction_mismatch @high_risk @fraud_detection
Scenario Outline: Detect transaction mismatches linked to fraudulent activities
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for transaction mismatches in high-risk transactions in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then mismatched transactions linked to fraudulent activities should be flagged
		And flagged cases should trigger an alert for compliance review
		And an escalation report should be generated for further investigation
Examples:
| file_name                                                   | sheet_name |
| bank_export_high_risk_transaction_mismatch.csv             | N/A        |
| bank_export_high_risk_transaction_mismatch.xlsx            | Sheet1     |
