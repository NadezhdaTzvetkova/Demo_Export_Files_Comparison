Feature: Validate Handling of Trailing and Leading Spaces in Structural Testing
@structural_tests @trailing_spaces @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Ensure trailing spaces are detected and flagged
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" with values containing leading or trailing spaces
	When the system processes the file
	Then all affected fields should be flagged in the validation report
		And the system should apply auto-trimming if configured
		And fields with persistent spaces should be escalated as "<severity>"
Examples:
| file_name                      | severity  |
| transactions_trailing_spaces.csv  | High      |
| transactions_leading_spaces.xlsx  | Medium    |
| transactions_mixed_spaces.csv     | Low       |
@structural_tests @trailing_spaces @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Validate error handling for trailing spaces
	Given an attempt to process a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When trailing or leading spaces are detected in "<column_name>"
	Then a system alert should notify relevant users
		And the issue should be escalated if the space count exceeds "<threshold>"
		And an auto-correction mechanism should be suggested if applicable
Examples:
| file_name                      | column_name          | threshold |
| transactions_spaces.csv        | Account Number       | 5         |
| transactions_padded.xlsx       | Currency Code        | 3         |
| transactions_extra_spaces.csv  | Transaction ID       | 10        |
@structural_tests @trailing_spaces @data_normalization
Scenario Outline: Ensure trailing spaces do not affect data consistency
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I compare "<column_name>" values in both systems
	Then leading and trailing spaces should not cause mismatches
		And fields should be normalized before validation
Examples:
| file_name                     | column_name          |
| transactions_spaces.csv        | Account Number       |
| transactions_padded.xlsx       | Currency Code        |
| transactions_extra_spaces.csv  | Transaction ID       |
@structural_tests @trailing_spaces @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Ensure batch processing handles whitespace issues correctly
	Given a batch of bank export files with leading and trailing spaces in multiple fields
	When the system processes them for validation
	Then all space-related discrepancies should be flagged as "<severity>"
		And processing should continue without failure
		And sanitized files should be saved separately for further review
Examples:
| severity  |
| High      |
| Medium    |
| Low       |
@structural_tests @trailing_spaces @performance_testing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate performance impact of trailing spaces validation
	Given a system processing "<file_count>" bank export files per hour
	When trailing spaces are present in "<year_range>"
	Then processing should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And system resources should not exceed "<resource_limit>%"
		And data integrity should be maintained throughout the process
Examples:
| file_count | year_range     | expected_time | resource_limit |
| 100        | 2015 - 2020    | 300           | 70            |
| 500        | 2021 - 2023    | 600           | 80            |
@structural_tests @trailing_spaces @schema_validation
Scenario Outline: Validate system behavior for schema mismatches due to trailing spaces
	Given an export file "<file_name>" containing space inconsistencies
	When I check the schema validation rules
	Then fields with excessive spaces should be flagged as "<error_severity>"
		And system logs should capture all whitespace-related issues
Examples:
| file_name                    | error_severity |
| transactions_legacy.csv       | High           |
| transactions_modified.xlsx    | Medium         |
| transactions_test.csv         | Low            |
@structural_tests @trailing_spaces @multi_column_validation
Scenario Outline: Verify multi-column impact of trailing spaces
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" with multiple columns containing trailing spaces
	When I check for inconsistencies across columns "<column_list>"
	Then all affected columns should be flagged
		And columns exceeding "<space_limit>" spaces should be marked as critical
Examples:
| file_name                          | column_list                         | space_limit |
| transactions_spaces_multi.csv       | Account Number, Transaction ID      | 5           |
| transactions_extra_spaces.xlsx      | Currency Code, Description          | 3           |
| transactions_padded_data.csv        | Amount, Transaction Date            | 7           |
@structural_tests @trailing_spaces @memory_usage_validation
Scenario Outline: Validate memory and CPU usage when handling excessive whitespace
	Given a system processing "<file_count>" large files with excessive spaces
	When the validation system runs
	Then the memory usage should not exceed "<max_memory_usage> MB"
		And processing should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
Examples:
| file_count | max_memory_usage | expected_time |
| 500        | 512              | 300           |
| 1000       | 1024             | 600           |
@structural_tests @trailing_spaces @delimiter_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure whitespace does not break delimiter consistency
	Given a CSV file "<file_name>" with leading/trailing spaces near delimiters
	When the system parses the file
	Then delimiter integrity should be preserved
		And no columns should shift due to space inconsistencies
Examples:
| file_name                          |
| transactions_trailing_delimiters.csv |
| transactions_extra_spaces_delim.csv |
