Feature: Validate Merged Cells in Structural Testing
@structural_tests @merged_cells @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Ensure merged cells do not affect data integrity
	Given a bank export file named "<file_name>" containing merged cells
	When the system processes the file
	Then merged cells should be detected and flagged as "<severity>"
		And a validation report should document the merged cell locations
		And if auto-splitting is enabled, the system should attempt to correct the issue
Examples:
| file_name                         | severity  |
| transactions_merged_cells.xlsx    | High      |
| transactions_partially_merged.xlsx | Medium   |
@structural_tests @merged_cells @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Validate error handling for merged cell detection
	Given an attempt to process a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When merged cells are detected in "<column_name>"
	Then a system alert should notify relevant users
		And the issue should be escalated if its severity level is "<severity_level>"
		And an auto-splitting mechanism should suggest corrections if applicable
		And if correction is not possible, the file should be rejected
Examples:
| file_name                     | column_name          | severity_level |
| transactions_2020.xlsx         | Transaction ID       | High           |
| transactions_2021.xlsx         | Date Column         | Medium         |
| transactions_test.xlsx         | Account Number      | Low            |
@structural_tests @merged_cells @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Ensure batch processing handles merged cells correctly
	Given a batch of bank export files with merged cell issues
	When the system processes them for validation
	Then all merged cell occurrences should be detected and flagged as "<severity>"
		And processing should continue without failure
		And incorrectly merged files should be logged separately for further review
Examples:
| severity  |
| High      |
| Medium    |
| Low       |
@structural_tests @merged_cells @performance_testing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate performance impact of merged cell validation
	Given a system processing "<file_count>" bank export files per hour
	When merged cells are present in "<year_range>"
	Then processing should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And system resources should not exceed "<resource_limit>%"
		And data integrity should be maintained throughout the process
Examples:
| file_count | year_range     | expected_time | resource_limit |
| 100        | 2015 - 2020    | 300           | 70            |
| 500        | 2021 - 2023    | 600           | 80            |
@structural_tests @merged_cells @schema_validation
Scenario Outline: Validate system behavior for merged cell schema mismatches
	Given an export file "<file_name>" with schema "<schema_type>"
	When I check the schema validation rules
	Then all merged cells should be split according to "<expected_format>"
		And any detected schema violations should be logged as "<error_severity>"
Examples:
| file_name                    | schema_type       | expected_format    | error_severity |
| transactions_legacy.xlsx      | Legacy Format    | Standard V1.2      | High           |
| transactions_modified.xlsx    | Custom Schema    | Standard V1.3      | Medium         |
| transactions_test.xlsx        | Test Environment | Test Format V2.0   | Low            |
