Feature: Validate Header Mismatch in Structural Testing
@structural_tests @header_mismatch @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Ensure headers match expected structure
	Given a bank export file named "<file_name>" with headers "<header_format>"
	When the system processes the file
	Then all headers should match the expected structure
		And any mismatched headers should be flagged as "<severity>"
		And a validation report should document header inconsistencies
		And if auto-mapping is enabled, a correction suggestion should be provided
Examples:
| file_name                         | header_format            | severity  |
| transactions_wrong_headers.csv    | Unexpected Column Order  | High      |
| transactions_missing_headers.xlsx | Missing Columns          | Medium    |
| transactions_case_mismatch.csv    | Case Sensitivity Issue   | Low       |
| transactions_data_type_mismatch.xlsx | Incorrect Data Types   | High      |
@structural_tests @header_mismatch @database_consistency
Scenario Outline: Validate database handling of mismatched headers
	Given a database expecting a predefined column structure
	When I compare imported headers from "<file_name>"
	Then all headers should align with the expected format
		And any mismatches should be flagged as "<discrepancy_type>"
		And system logs should capture all header-related issues
		And a rollback should be triggered if a critical header mismatch is found
Examples:
| file_name                         | discrepancy_type       |
| transactions_wrong_headers.csv    | Header Misalignment    |
| transactions_missing_headers.xlsx | Missing Header         |
| transactions_reordered_headers.csv | Reordered Headers     |
| transactions_duplicate_headers.xlsx | Duplicate Headers     |
@structural_tests @header_mismatch @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Ensure batch processing handles header mismatches correctly
	Given a batch of bank export files with header inconsistencies
	When the system processes them for validation
	Then all header mismatches should be detected and flagged as "<severity>"
		And processing should continue without failure
		And mismatched files should be logged separately for further review
Examples:
| severity  |
| High      |
| Medium    |
| Low       |
@structural_tests @header_mismatch @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Verify error handling for header mismatches
	Given an attempt to process a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When header mismatches such as "<error_type>" are detected
	Then a system alert should notify relevant users
		And the issue should be escalated if its severity level is "<severity_level>"
		And an auto-mapping mechanism should suggest appropriate corrections
		And if correction is not possible, the file should be rejected
Examples:
| file_name                      | error_type          | severity_level |
| transactions_2019.csv          | Unexpected Header   | High           |
| transactions_2021.xlsx         | Misaligned Headers  | Medium         |
| transactions_2023_with_errors.csv | Extra Headers   | Low            |
@structural_tests @header_mismatch @performance_testing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate performance impact of header validation
	Given a system processing "<file_count>" bank export files per hour
	When header mismatches are present in "<year_range>"
	Then processing should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And system resources should not exceed "<resource_limit>%"
		And header integrity should be maintained throughout the process
		And if resource utilization exceeds "<critical_limit>%", an alert should be triggered
Examples:
| file_count | year_range     | expected_time | resource_limit | critical_limit |
| 100        | 2015 - 2020    | 300           | 70            | 90             |
| 500        | 2021 - 2023    | 600           | 80            | 95             |
@structural_tests @header_mismatch @schema_validation
Scenario Outline: Validate system behavior for header schema mismatches
	Given an export file "<file_name>" with schema "<schema_type>"
	When I check the schema validation rules
	Then headers should conform to the expected schema format "<expected_format>"
		And any detected schema violations should be logged as "<error_severity>"
Examples:
| file_name                   | schema_type       | expected_format    | error_severity |
| transactions_legacy.csv      | Legacy Format    | Standard V1.2      | High           |
| transactions_modified.xlsx   | Custom Schema    | Standard V1.3      | Medium         |
| transactions_test.csv        | Test Environment | Test Format V2.0   | Low            |
