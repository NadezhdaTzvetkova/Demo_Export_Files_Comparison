Feature: Validate Handling of Protected Sheets in Structural Testing
@structural_tests @protected_sheets @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Ensure protected sheets are detected and flagged
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" with a protected sheet "<sheet_name>"
	When the system processes the file
	Then the protection level should be identified as "<protection_type>"
		And a validation report should document the protection settings
		And if credentials are available, the sheet should be unlocked for processing
Examples:
| file_name                      | sheet_name          | protection_type    |
| transactions_protected.xlsx    | Transactions Data   | Read-Only          |
| transactions_password.xlsx     | Summary Sheet      | Password-Protected |
| transactions_locked_rows.xlsx  | Account Balances   | Partially Locked   |
@structural_tests @protected_sheets @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Validate error handling for protected sheets
	Given an attempt to process a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When a protected sheet "<sheet_name>" is encountered
	Then a system alert should notify relevant users
		And the issue should be escalated if the protection level is "<severity_level>"
		And an override attempt should be logged if credentials are provided
Examples:
| file_name                     | sheet_name          | severity_level |
| transactions_protected.xlsx   | Transactions Data   | High           |
| summary_protected.xlsx        | Summary Report     | Medium         |
| locked_accounts.xlsx          | Account Balances   | Low            |
@structural_tests @protected_sheets @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Ensure batch processing handles protected sheets correctly
	Given a batch of bank export files with protected sheets
	When the system processes them for validation
	Then all protected sheets should be detected and flagged as "<severity>"
		And processing should continue if read-only access is available
		And inaccessible files should be logged separately for further review
Examples:
| severity  |
| High      |
| Medium    |
| Low       |
@structural_tests @protected_sheets @performance_testing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate performance impact of protected sheet validation
	Given a system processing "<file_count>" bank export files per hour
	When protected sheets are present in "<year_range>"
	Then processing should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And system resources should not exceed "<resource_limit>%"
		And data integrity should be maintained throughout the process
Examples:
| file_count | year_range     | expected_time | resource_limit |
| 100        | 2015 - 2020    | 300           | 70            |
| 500        | 2021 - 2023    | 600           | 80            |
