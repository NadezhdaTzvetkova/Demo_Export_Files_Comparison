Feature: Validate Column Format Consistency in Structural Testing
@structural_tests @column_format_validation @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Ensure column formats adhere to expected data types
	Given a bank export file named "<file_name>" with column formats defined as "<expected_format>"
	When the system processes the file
	Then all columns should match the expected format
		And any format mismatches should be flagged as "<severity>"
		And a validation report should confirm format integrity
Examples:
| file_name                | expected_format  | severity  |
| transactions_2022.csv    | Numeric, Date, String | High      |
| transactions_2023.xlsx   | Alphanumeric, Date | Medium    |
@structural_tests @column_format_validation @database_consistency
Scenario Outline: Validate database column format mappings
	Given a database with expected column formats in "<expected_format>"
	When I compare imported column formats from "<file_name>"
	Then all columns should match the expected data type
		And any discrepancies should be logged as "<discrepancy_type>"
		And alerts should be generated for critical mismatches
Examples:
| file_name                | expected_format      | discrepancy_type  |
| transactions_numeric.csv | Numeric, Date, Text | Data Type Mismatch  |
| transactions_text.xlsx   | String, Date        | Unexpected Format  |
@structural_tests @column_format_validation @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Ensure batch processing maintains column format consistency
	Given a batch of bank export files with columns formatted as "<format_type>"
	When the system processes them for validation
	Then all columns should adhere to the correct format
		And any detected inconsistencies should be flagged as "<severity>"
Examples:
| format_type   | severity  |
| Numeric       | High      |
| Alphanumeric  | Medium    |
| Mixed         | Low       |
@structural_tests @column_format_validation @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Verify error handling for column format inconsistencies
	Given an attempt to process a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When a column format inconsistency such as "<error_type>" is detected
	Then a system alert should notify relevant users
		And the issue should be escalated if its severity level is "<severity_level>"
		And an automated correction mechanism should attempt to adjust the column format
Examples:
| file_name                | error_type         | severity_level |
| transactions_2019.csv    | Incorrect Data Type | High           |
| transactions_2021.xlsx   | Unexpected Symbols | Medium         |
@structural_tests @column_format_validation @performance_testing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate performance impact of column format validation
	Given a system processing "<file_count>" bank export files per hour
	When checking for column format variations in "<year_range>"
	Then processing should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And system resources should not exceed "<resource_limit>%"
		And column format consistency should remain stable throughout the process
Examples:
| file_count | year_range     | expected_time | resource_limit |
| 100       | 2015 - 2020    | 300           | 70            |
| 500       | 2021 - 2023    | 600           | 80            |
