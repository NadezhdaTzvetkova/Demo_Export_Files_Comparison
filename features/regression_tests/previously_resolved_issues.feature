Feature: Validate Resolution of Previously Reported Issues in Export File Processing
@regression_tests @previously_resolved_issues @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Ensure previously resolved data issues do not reoccur
	Given a bank export file named "<file_name>" containing previously resolved issues
	When I process the file
	Then the issues should not reoccur
		And a validation report should confirm their resolution
		And any reoccurrence should be flagged as "<severity>"
Examples:
| file_name                | severity  |
| transactions_2022.csv    | High      |
| transactions_2023.xlsx   | Medium    |
@regression_tests @previously_resolved_issues @database_consistency
Scenario Outline: Validate database consistency for previously resolved issues
	Given a database that had past issues with "<issue_type>"
	When I compare the latest records with previous resolutions
	Then no past issues should reappear
		And any detected inconsistencies should be logged as "<discrepancy_type>"
		And an alert should be generated if critical issues reoccur
Examples:
| issue_type            | discrepancy_type  |
| Duplicate Transactions | Unexpected Duplicates |
| Invalid Currencies     | Non-standard Codes  |
@regression_tests @previously_resolved_issues @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Ensure batch processing maintains resolved data consistency
	Given a batch of bank export files from "<year_range>" containing previously flagged issues
	When I process them for validation
	Then all records should pass consistency checks
		And no previously resolved issues should reoccur
		And any detected issues should be flagged as "<severity>"
Examples:
| year_range     | severity  |
| 2018 - 2022   | High      |
| 2023 - 2024   | Medium    |
@regression_tests @previously_resolved_issues @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Verify proper error handling for regression of resolved issues
	Given an attempt to process a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When previously resolved issues such as "<error_type>" are detected again
	Then a system alert should notify relevant users
		And the issue should be escalated if its severity level is "<severity_level>"
		And a historical report should be updated with the reoccurrence
Examples:
| file_name                | error_type               | severity_level |
| transactions_2019.csv    | Corrupted Data Reentry  | High           |
| transactions_2021.xlsx   | Unexpected Null Values  | Medium         |
@regression_tests @previously_resolved_issues @performance_testing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate performance impact of verifying resolved issues
	Given a system processing "<file_count>" bank export files per hour
	When checking for previously resolved issues in "<year_range>"
	Then processing should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And system resources should not exceed "<resource_limit>%"
		And data integrity should remain stable throughout the process
Examples:
| file_count | year_range     | expected_time | resource_limit |
| 100       | 2015 - 2020    | 300           | 70            |
| 500       | 2021 - 2023    | 600           | 80            |
