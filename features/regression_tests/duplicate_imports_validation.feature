Feature: Validate Duplicate Imports Handling in Export File Processing
@regression_tests @duplicate_imports @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Prevent duplicate file imports
	Given a previously processed bank export file named "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to import the same file again
	Then the system should detect the duplicate import attempt
		And an error message "<error_message>" should be displayed
		And the duplicate file should not be processed
Examples:
| file_name                        | error_message                |
| transactions_export.csv         | File already processed       |
| transactions_export.xlsx        | File already processed       |
@regression_tests @duplicate_imports @database_integrity
Scenario Outline: Ensure database integrity with duplicate imports
	Given a database containing records from "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to import the same file again
	Then no duplicate records should be inserted
		And a log entry should be created stating "<log_message>"
		And database consistency should remain intact
Examples:
| file_name                        | log_message                  |
| transactions_export.csv         | Duplicate file ignored       |
| transactions_export.xlsx        | Duplicate file ignored       |
@regression_tests @duplicate_imports @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Validate batch import behavior with duplicate files
	Given a batch of bank export files including a duplicate file named "<file_name>"
	When I process the batch
	Then only unique files should be imported
		And duplicate files should be skipped with a warning "<warning_message>"
		And the processing should not be interrupted
Examples:
| file_name                        | warning_message              |
| transactions_export.csv         | Skipping duplicate file      |
| transactions_export.xlsx        | Skipping duplicate file      |
@regression_tests @duplicate_imports @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Validate error handling for duplicate imports
	Given an attempt to import a duplicate file named "<file_name>"
	When the system detects the duplicate
	Then a user notification should be sent with "<notification_message>"
		And an audit log should capture the duplicate attempt
		And the system should continue processing without failure
Examples:
| file_name                        | notification_message         |
| transactions_export.csv         | Duplicate file detected      |
| transactions_export.xlsx        | Duplicate file detected      |
@regression_tests @duplicate_imports @performance_testing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate performance impact of detecting duplicate imports
	Given a system processing "<file_count>" export files per minute
	When "<duplicate_count>" duplicate files are included
	Then the duplicate detection should not cause significant processing delay
		And processing speed should remain above "<expected_speed>" files per minute
		And system performance should not degrade significantly
Examples:
| file_count | duplicate_count | expected_speed |
| 100       | 10              | 90            |
| 500       | 50              | 450           |
