Feature: Validate High-Volume Transaction Processing in Regression Testing
@regression_tests @high_volume_transactions @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Validate transaction integrity in high-volume files
	Given a bank export file named "<file_name>" containing "<transaction_count>" transactions
	When the system processes the file
	Then all transactions should be recorded accurately
		And no data loss or corruption should occur
		And a processing report should confirm consistency
Examples:
| file_name                  | transaction_count |
| high_volume_2022.csv       | 1,000,000        |
| high_volume_2023.xlsx      | 5,000,000        |
@regression_tests @high_volume_transactions @database_performance
Scenario Outline: Ensure database performance under high transaction load
	Given a database containing "<transaction_count>" transactions
	When a query retrieves transactions from the last "<time_period>"
	Then the query should execute within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And database indexes should be properly utilized
		And no transaction failures should occur due to overload
Examples:
| transaction_count | time_period  | expected_time |
| 10,000,000       | 1 Year       | 3            |
| 50,000,000       | 5 Years      | 10           |
@regression_tests @high_volume_transactions @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Validate batch processing efficiency for high-volume transactions
	Given "<batch_count>" bank export files each containing "<transaction_count>" transactions
	When the system processes these files in parallel
	Then all transactions should be processed within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And system memory consumption should remain under "<memory_limit>%"
		And processing logs should capture all batch operations
Examples:
| batch_count | transaction_count | expected_time | memory_limit |
| 10         | 1,000,000         | 300           | 70          |
| 50         | 500,000           | 900           | 80          |
@regression_tests @high_volume_transactions @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure proper error handling for high transaction loads
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" with "<error_type>" errors in "<error_percentage>%" of transactions
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then all errors should be logged properly
		And valid transactions should continue processing
		And an error summary report should be generated
Examples:
| file_name                  | error_type        | error_percentage |
| high_volume_2022_errors.csv | Missing Fields    | 5                |
| high_volume_2023_errors.xlsx| Invalid Amounts   | 10               |
@regression_tests @high_volume_transactions @performance_testing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate system performance under extreme transaction volumes
	Given a system processing "<transaction_count>" transactions per second
	When the transaction load increases by "<increase_percentage>%"
	Then the system should scale dynamically without degradation
		And response times should remain within "<response_time>" milliseconds
Examples:
| transaction_count | increase_percentage | response_time |
| 100,000          | 50                  | 200          |
| 500,000          | 100                 | 500          |
@regression_tests @high_volume_transactions @network_latency
Scenario Outline: Simulate network latency effects on high-volume transaction processing
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" with "<transaction_count>" transactions and simulated network latency of "<latency>" ms
	When I attempt to process the file remotely
	Then the system should retry within an acceptable time frame
		And an alert should be generated if latency exceeds "<latency_threshold>" ms
		And processing should not hang indefinitely
Examples:
| file_name                   | transaction_count | latency | latency_threshold |
| high_volume_network_2022.csv | 1,000,000        | 500     | 1000              |
| high_volume_network_2023.xlsx| 5,000,000        | 1000    | 2000              |
