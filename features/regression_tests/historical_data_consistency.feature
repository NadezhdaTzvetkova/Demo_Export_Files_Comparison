Feature: Validate Historical Data Consistency in Export File Processing
@regression_tests @historical_data @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Ensure historical data remains unchanged over time
	Given a historical bank export file named "<file_name>" from "<year>"
	When I compare it with the latest processed version
	Then the historical records should remain identical
		And no unauthorized modifications should be detected
		And a validation report should be generated
Examples:
| file_name                 | year |
| transactions_2020.csv     | 2020 |
| transactions_2021.xlsx    | 2021 |
@regression_tests @historical_data @database_consistency
Scenario Outline: Validate historical data consistency in the database
	Given a database containing historical records from "<year>"
	When I compare the stored records with the latest export file "<file_name>"
	Then all records should match exactly
		And any discrepancies should be logged as "<discrepancy_type>"
		And a detailed report should be generated
Examples:
| file_name                 | year | discrepancy_type  |
| transactions_2020.csv     | 2020 | Missing Entries  |
| transactions_2021.xlsx    | 2021 | Modified Amounts |
@regression_tests @historical_data @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Validate batch processing of historical data comparisons
	Given a batch of historical bank export files from "<year_range>"
	When I process them for consistency checking
	Then all historical records should be verified
		And discrepancies should be flagged with severity levels "<severity>"
		And the process should not impact system performance
Examples:
| year_range     | severity  |
| 2015 - 2020   | High      |
| 2021 - 2023   | Medium    |
@regression_tests @historical_data @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure proper error handling for historical data inconsistencies
	Given an attempt to validate historical data from "<file_name>"
	When inconsistencies such as "<error_type>" are found
	Then a detailed log should capture all errors
		And the system should notify relevant users with "<notification_message>"
		And processing should continue for valid records
Examples:
| file_name                 | error_type            | notification_message |
| transactions_2018.csv     | Corrupted Data        | Data validation alert |
| transactions_2019.xlsx    | Unexpected Changes    | Data mismatch alert  |
@regression_tests @historical_data @performance_testing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate performance impact of historical data validation
	Given a system processing "<file_count>" historical export files per hour
	When comparisons involve large datasets from "<year_range>"
	Then processing should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And system resources should not exceed "<resource_limit>%"
		And database queries should remain optimized
Examples:
| file_count | year_range     | expected_time | resource_limit |
| 100       | 2010 - 2020    | 300           | 70            |
| 500       | 2015 - 2023    | 600           | 80            |
