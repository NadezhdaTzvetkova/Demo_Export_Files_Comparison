Feature: Basel III Capital Validation

@capital_requirements @financial_compliance
Scenario Outline: Validate Basel III capital adequacy reports
    Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
    When I check the "Tier 1 Capital", "Risk-Weighted Assets", and "Capital Ratio" fields in "<sheet_name>"
    Then all values should match the Basel III calculation formula "<formula>"
        And reports failing to meet "<capital_threshold>" should be flagged for regulatory review

    Examples:
      | file_name                            | sheet_name | formula                  | capital_threshold |
      | bank_export_basel_iii_report.csv    | N/A        | (Tier1 Capital / RWA)    | 8%                 |
      | bank_export_liquidity_ratios.xlsx   | Sheet1     | LCR = HQLA / Net Outflow | 100%               |

@capital_requirements @stress_testing @edge_case
Scenario Outline: Ensure stress testing calculations adhere to Basel III requirements
    Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
    When I apply stress testing scenarios using "<stress_test_methodology>"
    Then capital adequacy should remain above "<stress_test_threshold>"
        And deviations beyond the threshold should be flagged for regulatory audit

    Examples:
      | file_name                            | sheet_name | stress_test_methodology | stress_test_threshold |
      | bank_export_basel_iii_stress.csv    | N/A        | Adverse Macro Scenario  | 5%                     |
      | bank_export_basel_iii_stress.xlsx   | Sheet1     | Severe Recession        | 6%                     |

@capital_requirements @risk_weighting @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Validate risk-weighted asset (RWA) calculations
    Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
    When I check the "Risk-Weighted Assets" column in "<sheet_name>"
    Then all RWA values should be computed correctly using "<rwa_formula>"
        And inconsistencies should be flagged for regulatory review

    Examples:
      | file_name                            | sheet_name | rwa_formula                        |
      | bank_export_rwa_validation.csv      | N/A        | Sum(Exposure Amount * Risk Weight) |
      | bank_export_rwa_validation.xlsx     | Sheet1     | Exposure * Regulatory Factor       |

@capital_requirements @liquidity_ratios @financial_stability
Scenario Outline: Validate Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) compliance
    Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
    When I check the "High-Quality Liquid Assets" and "Net Cash Outflows" in "<sheet_name>"
    Then the liquidity coverage ratio should be calculated as "<lcr_formula>"
        And reports with LCR below "<lcr_threshold>" should be flagged for liquidity risk

    Examples:
      | file_name                            | sheet_name | lcr_formula           | lcr_threshold |
      | bank_export_liquidity_ratios.csv    | N/A        | LCR = HQLA / Net Outflow | 100%         |
      | bank_export_liquidity_ratios.xlsx   | Sheet1     | HQLA / Stress Outflow  | 90%          |

@capital_requirements @net_stable_funding_ratio @long_term_liquidity
Scenario Outline: Ensure Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) meets Basel III standards
    Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
    When I check the "Available Stable Funding" and "Required Stable Funding" in "<sheet_name>"
    Then the NSFR should be calculated as "<nsfr_formula>"
        And reports with NSFR below "<nsfr_threshold>" should be flagged for stability risks

    Examples:
      | file_name                            | sheet_name | nsfr_formula                   | nsfr_threshold |
      | bank_export_nsfr_test.csv           | N/A        | Available Stable Funding / Required Stable Funding | 100% |
      | bank_export_nsfr_test.xlsx          | Sheet1     | ASF / RSF                      | 90%  |

@capital_requirements @tier_1_vs_tier_2 @capital_structure
Scenario Outline: Verify the composition of Tier 1 vs. Tier 2 capital
    Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
    When I compare "Tier 1 Capital" and "Tier 2 Capital" values in "<sheet_name>"
    Then the proportion of Tier 1 capital should meet the required "<tier_1_minimum>"
        And Tier 2 capital should not exceed "<tier_2_maximum>"

    Examples:
      | file_name                            | sheet_name | tier_1_minimum | tier_2_maximum |
      | bank_export_capital_structure.csv   | N/A        | 75%            | 25%            |
      | bank_export_capital_structure.xlsx  | Sheet1     | 80%            | 20%            |

@capital_requirements @edge_case @large_files @performance
Scenario Outline: Validate Basel III compliance in large banking datasets
    Given a bank export file "<file_name>" with over "<row_count>" records
    When I check the "Tier 1 Capital", "Risk-Weighted Assets", and "Liquidity Ratios"
    Then all calculations should be performed efficiently within "<expected_runtime>"
        And any performance bottlenecks should be logged for optimization

    Examples:
      | file_name                               | row_count  | expected_runtime |
      | bank_export_large_dataset_test.csv     | 500,000    | 10 minutes       |
      | bank_export_large_dataset_test.xlsx    | 1,000,000  | 20 minutes       |
