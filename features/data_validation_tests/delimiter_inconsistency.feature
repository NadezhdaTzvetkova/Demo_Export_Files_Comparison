Feature: Validate Delimiter Inconsistency in Bank Export Files
@delimiter_validation @format_check @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Ensure delimiter consistency throughout the file
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the delimiter format in the file
	Then the delimiter should be consistent throughout the file
		And mixed delimiters within the file should be flagged
		And an error report should be generated listing inconsistent delimiters
Examples:
| file_name                              |
| bank_export_baseline_test.csv         |
| bank_export_baseline_test.xlsx        |
@delimiter_validation @mixed_delimiters @edge_case
Scenario Outline: Detect files with inconsistent delimiters
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the delimiter format in the file
	Then inconsistent delimiters such as mixed commas and semicolons should be detected
		And lines with incorrect delimiters should be logged separately
		And a suggestion should be provided to standardize delimiters
Examples:
| file_name                              |
| bank_export_mixed_delimiters_test.csv |
| bank_export_mixed_delimiters_test.xlsx |
@delimiter_validation @delimiter_mismatch @format_standardization
Scenario Outline: Ensure files use the expected delimiter
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the delimiter format in the file
	Then the file should use the expected delimiter "<expected_delimiter>"
		And files with a different delimiter should be flagged
		And a conversion option should be suggested
		And system should auto-adjust parsing logic if configured
Examples:
| file_name                                | expected_delimiter |
| bank_export_comma_delimiter_test.csv    | ,                  |
| bank_export_semicolon_delimiter_test.xlsx | ;                 |
@delimiter_validation @multi_delimiter_support @format_flexibility
Scenario Outline: Ensure system correctly handles multiple delimiters
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the delimiter format in the file
	Then files containing multiple valid delimiters "<allowed_delimiters>" should be accepted
		And unexpected delimiters should be flagged
Examples:
| file_name                             | allowed_delimiters |
| bank_export_flexible_delimiters.csv  | , | ; | TAB        |
| bank_export_mixed_delimiters.xlsx    | , | | | ;          |
@delimiter_validation @delimiter_malformed @corrupted_data
Scenario Outline: Detect malformed data caused by delimiter errors
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I parse the file content
	Then malformed data due to incorrect delimiters should be identified
		And such records should be flagged for manual review
		And a structured log should list affected rows with recommended fixes
Examples:
| file_name                                |
| bank_export_malformed_delimiter_test.csv |
| bank_export_malformed_delimiter_test.xlsx |
@delimiter_validation @incomplete_records @data_loss_prevention
Scenario Outline: Detect truncated or split records due to delimiter issues
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I parse the file
	Then rows with missing or extra delimiters should be flagged
		And records should be reviewed for data loss risks
		And an auto-repair mechanism should attempt to reconstruct affected rows
Examples:
| file_name                                  |
| bank_export_truncated_records_test.csv    |
| bank_export_extra_delimiters_test.xlsx    |
@delimiter_validation @delimiter_escape_character @special_character_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure proper handling of delimiter escape sequences
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the delimiter format in the file
	Then escape sequences such as "\" should be handled correctly
		And quoted values containing delimiters should be properly parsed
		And improperly escaped delimiters should be flagged for correction
Examples:
| file_name                                  |
| bank_export_escape_character_test.csv     |
| bank_export_quoted_delimiters_test.xlsx   |
@delimiter_validation @large_files @performance_testing
Scenario Outline: Validate delimiter consistency in large files
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the delimiter format in a file with "<row_count>" rows
	Then the delimiter should be consistent in all rows
		And inconsistent delimiters should be flagged for bulk correction
		And performance benchmarks should be recorded
Examples:
| file_name                                  | row_count  |
| bank_export_large_file_delimiter_test.csv | 100000     |
| bank_export_large_file_delimiter_test.xlsx | 500000     |
@delimiter_validation @regulatory_compliance @financial_reports
Scenario Outline: Ensure delimiter consistency in regulatory reports
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check delimiter formats in "<report_type>"
	Then delimiters should follow "<regulatory_standard>"
		And files not adhering to regulatory delimiter rules should be flagged
Examples:
| file_name                                  | report_type              | regulatory_standard |
| bank_export_tax_report_2023.csv          | Annual Tax Report        | IRS Financial Guide |
| bank_export_basel_compliance.xlsx        | Basel III Compliance     | ISO 20022           |
@delimiter_validation @corrupt_data_handling @edge_case
Scenario Outline: Detect corrupt or unreadable delimiter patterns
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the file for parsing failures
	Then records with unexpected delimiter patterns should be flagged as "<error_type>"
		And the system should suggest corrective action
Examples:
| file_name                               | error_type            |
| transactions_corrupt_delimiters.csv    | Encoding Error        |
| transactions_incorrect_separator.xlsx  | Parsing Failure       |
