Feature: Validate Encoding Consistency in Bank Export Files
@encoding_validation @format_check @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Ensure file encoding is UTF-8 or ASCII
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the file encoding
	Then the file encoding should be "<expected_encoding>"
		And non-standard encodings should be flagged
		And the system should suggest converting to a standard encoding
		And a conversion report should list all affected files
Examples:
| file_name                              | expected_encoding |
| bank_export_baseline_test.csv         | UTF-8             |
| bank_export_baseline_test.xlsx        | ASCII             |
@encoding_validation @non_utf8_encoding @edge_case
Scenario Outline: Detect files with non-UTF-8 encoding
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the file encoding
	Then files encoded in "<non_standard_encoding>" should be flagged
		And conversion options should be suggested
		And encoding-related errors should be logged
Examples:
| file_name                              | non_standard_encoding |
| bank_export_non_utf8_encoding_test.csv | ISO-8859-1            |
| bank_export_non_utf8_encoding_test.xlsx | UTF-16                |
@encoding_validation @invalid_characters @data_corruption
Scenario Outline: Detect invalid characters due to encoding issues
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I scan the file for encoding errors
	Then non-printable or special characters should be flagged
		And invalid characters should be replaced or removed as per system policy
		And an error report should be generated
		And system should attempt auto-correction if enabled
Examples:
| file_name                               |
| bank_export_invalid_characters_test.csv |
| bank_export_invalid_characters_test.xlsx |
@encoding_validation @mixed_encodings @corrupted_data
Scenario Outline: Detect mixed encoding formats within a single file
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the encoding format of each row
	Then rows with inconsistent encodings should be flagged
		And a structured log should list affected rows with recommended fixes
		And encoding mismatches should be highlighted for manual review
Examples:
| file_name                                  |
| bank_export_mixed_encoding_test.csv       |
| bank_export_mixed_encoding_test.xlsx      |
@encoding_validation @large_files @performance_testing
Scenario Outline: Validate encoding consistency in large files
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the encoding format in a file with "<row_count>" rows
	Then encoding should be consistent across all rows
		And inconsistencies should be flagged for bulk correction
		And performance benchmarks should be recorded
Examples:
| file_name                                    | row_count |
| bank_export_large_file_encoding_test.csv    | 100000    |
| bank_export_large_file_encoding_test.xlsx   | 500000    |
@encoding_validation @regulatory_compliance @financial_reports
Scenario Outline: Ensure encoding consistency in regulatory reports
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check encoding compliance in "<report_type>"
	Then encoding should follow "<regulatory_standard>"
		And non-compliant files should be flagged for review
Examples:
| file_name                                  | report_type                  | regulatory_standard |
| bank_export_tax_report_2023.csv          | Annual Tax Report            | UTF-8 (IRS Standard) |
| bank_export_basel_compliance.xlsx        | Basel III Compliance Report  | ISO 20022            |
@encoding_validation @data_integrity @anomaly_detection
Scenario Outline: Detect anomalous encoding shifts within structured data
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I analyze character encoding patterns
	Then unexpected shifts in encoding within records should be flagged
		And auto-repair mechanisms should attempt corrections
		And audit logs should track encoding anomalies
Examples:
| file_name                                |
| bank_export_encoding_anomalies_test.csv |
| bank_export_encoding_anomalies_test.xlsx |
@encoding_validation @corrupt_data_handling @edge_case
Scenario Outline: Detect corrupt or unreadable encoding formats
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the file for parsing failures
	Then records with unreadable encoding should be flagged as "<error_type>"
		And the system should suggest corrective action
Examples:
| file_name                               | error_type            |
| transactions_corrupt_encoding.csv      | Encoding Error        |
| transactions_incorrect_charset.xlsx    | Parsing Failure       |
@encoding_validation @error_resilience @data_recovery
Scenario Outline: Validate system resilience against encoding conversion errors
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" with incorrect encoding
	When I attempt to convert it to "<target_encoding>"
	Then system should preserve data integrity
		And corrupted fields should be flagged for manual review
Examples:
| file_name                            | target_encoding |
| bank_export_wrong_encoding_test.csv | UTF-8           |
| bank_export_wrong_encoding_test.xlsx | ASCII           |
