Feature: Validate Missing Values in Export Files
@missing_values @data_quality @mandatory_fields
Scenario Outline: Ensure no mandatory fields are empty
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for missing values in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then no mandatory field should be empty or null
		And missing values should be flagged
		And the system should suggest potential corrections based on historical data
		And an error report should be generated listing affected rows
		And records with missing values should be categorized based on "<priority>"
Examples:
| file_name                              | sheet_name | priority  |
| bank_export_baseline_test.csv         | N/A        | High      |
| bank_export_baseline_test.xlsx        | Sheet1     | Medium    |
@missing_values @transaction_data @edge_case
Scenario Outline: Detect missing values in key transaction fields
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for missing values in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then transaction fields such as "Transaction ID", "Date", "Amount", and "Account Number" should not be empty
		And missing values should be flagged for review
		And the system should validate if missing data can be inferred based on surrounding transactions
		And an alert should be raised for critical fields marked as "<critical_level>"
Examples:
| file_name                                | sheet_name | critical_level |
| bank_export_missing_transaction_values.csv  | N/A        | High           |
| bank_export_missing_transaction_values.xlsx | Sheet1     | Medium         |
@missing_values @currency_codes @data_consistency
Scenario Outline: Detect missing currency codes and suggest corrections
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the "Currency" column in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then missing currency codes should be flagged
		And the system should suggest the most probable currency based on account history
		And flagged transactions should be reviewed manually
		And if historical data is insufficient, an escalation should be made to "<escalation_team>"
Examples:
| file_name                               | sheet_name | escalation_team  |
| bank_export_missing_currency_test.csv  | N/A        | Compliance Team  |
| bank_export_missing_currency_test.xlsx | Sheet1     | Risk Management  |
@missing_values @reference_data @lookup_validation
Scenario Outline: Validate missing reference data fields
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for missing reference data in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then fields such as "Bank Code", "Branch Code", and "Swift Code" should not be missing
		And missing reference data should be flagged with "<severity>"
		And system should attempt auto-fill using existing master data
Examples:
| file_name                                      | sheet_name | severity |
| bank_export_missing_reference_data_test.csv   | N/A        | High     |
| bank_export_missing_reference_data_test.xlsx  | Sheet1     | Medium   |
@missing_values @edge_case @large_files @performance
Scenario Outline: Validate missing values in large datasets
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for missing values in a file with more than 100,000 rows
	Then all missing values should be detected efficiently
		And system performance should be benchmarked for optimization
		And a detailed report should be generated with missing value statistics
		And missing data should be categorized for batch processing "<batch_status>"
Examples:
| file_name                               | sheet_name | batch_status  |
| bank_export_large_file_missing_values.csv | N/A        | In Progress   |
| bank_export_large_file_missing_values.xlsx | Sheet1     | Pending       |
@missing_values @high_risk @fraud_detection
Scenario Outline: Detect missing values in high-risk transactions
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for missing values in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then high-risk transactions missing key information should be flagged
		And missing values should trigger an alert for fraud analysis
		And flagged transactions should be escalated for further investigation
		And transactions should be checked against "<fraud_prevention_rule>"
Examples:
| file_name                                  | sheet_name | fraud_prevention_rule  |
| bank_export_high_risk_missing_values.csv  | N/A        | Rule #110 - Fraud Watch |
| bank_export_high_risk_missing_values.xlsx | Sheet1     | Rule #215 - High Risk   |
@missing_values @error_handling @bulk_processing
Scenario Outline: Handle missing values in batch file processing
	Given a batch of bank export files "<batch_file_name>"
	When I process them for missing values
	Then missing values should be flagged with "<error_code>"
		And files with excessive missing values should be marked as "<rejection_status>"
		And missing field auto-fix attempts should be "<auto_fix_status>"
Examples:
| batch_file_name                         | error_code  | rejection_status | auto_fix_status |
| batch_missing_data_2024-03-01.csv       | MV-001      | Rejected         | Disabled        |
| batch_missing_data_2024-03-02.xlsx      | MV-002      | Needs Review     | Enabled         |
@missing_values @edge_case @historical_trends
Scenario Outline: Validate missing values based on historical trends
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for missing values in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then missing values should be analyzed against past exports
		And transactions with recurring missing values should be flagged for "<trend_analysis_status>"
		And historical patterns should be documented for anomaly detection
Examples:
| file_name                                    | sheet_name | trend_analysis_status |
| bank_export_historical_missing_values.csv   | N/A        | Repeating Issue       |
| bank_export_historical_missing_values.xlsx  | Sheet1     | One-time Anomaly      |
@missing_values @dynamic_thresholds @adaptive_thresholds
Scenario Outline: Adaptive validation for missing values based on transaction type
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for missing values in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then missing values should be evaluated based on "<transaction_type>"
		And thresholds should dynamically adjust for "<risk_category>"
		And critical missing values should trigger "<escalation_action>"
Examples:
| file_name                              | sheet_name | transaction_type       | risk_category | escalation_action |
| bank_export_missing_transactions.csv  | N/A        | Wire Transfer         | High          | Immediate Review  |
