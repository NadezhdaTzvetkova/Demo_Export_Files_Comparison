Feature: Handle Edge Cases in Export Files
@edge_cases @empty_files @validation
Scenario Outline: Validate handling of empty export files
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then the system should detect it as empty
		And an appropriate error message should be returned
		And the file should be excluded from processing
		And a system log entry should be recorded for tracking
Examples:
| file_name                          |
| bank_export_empty_file.csv         |
| bank_export_empty_file.xlsx        |
@edge_cases @empty_files @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure system stability when processing multiple empty files
	Given a batch of bank export files:
| file_name                          |
| <file_1>                           |
| <file_2>                           |
| <file_3>                           |
	When I attempt to process these files
	Then the system should continue processing non-empty files
		And an appropriate error should be logged for each empty file
		And system resources should remain stable
Examples:
| file_1                              | file_2                              | file_3                              |
| bank_export_empty_file_1.csv       | bank_export_empty_file_2.csv       | bank_export_empty_file_3.csv       |
| bank_export_empty_file_1.xlsx      | bank_export_empty_file_2.xlsx      | bank_export_empty_file_3.xlsx      |
@edge_cases @null_values @data_validation
Scenario Outline: Detect missing values in critical fields
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the "<column_name>" column in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then records with missing values should be flagged
		And a report should be generated listing the affected rows
		And a recommendation should be provided for data correction
Examples:
| file_name                          | column_name          | sheet_name |
| bank_export_null_values.csv        | Transaction Amount   | N/A        |
| bank_export_null_values.xlsx       | Account Holder Name  | Sheet1     |
@edge_cases @outlier_detection @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Detect transaction outliers based on amount
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I analyze the "Amount" column in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then transactions exceeding the threshold of "<threshold_value>" should be flagged
		And flagged transactions should be logged for further review
		And recommendations for corrective action should be generated
Examples:
| file_name                              | sheet_name | threshold_value |
| bank_export_outliers_transactions.csv  | N/A        | 100000          |
| bank_export_outliers_transactions.xlsx | Sheet1     | 50000           |
@edge_cases @outlier_detection @fraud_detection
Scenario Outline: Identify potential fraudulent transactions using anomaly detection
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for outliers in high-risk transactions in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then transactions significantly deviating from normal patterns should be flagged as suspicious
		And flagged transactions should be escalated for compliance review
		And an anomaly detection report should be generated
Examples:
| file_name                                       | sheet_name |
| bank_export_fraud_outliers.csv                 | N/A        |
| bank_export_fraud_outliers.xlsx                | Sheet1     |
@edge_cases @outlier_detection @data_quality @threshold
Scenario Outline: Validate outliers against historical transaction patterns
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I compare the "<column_name>" column with historical data
	Then records with values beyond "<threshold>%" of the historical average should be flagged
		And corrective action should be suggested
		And an alert should be generated for data quality review
Examples:
| file_name                              | column_name        | threshold |
| bank_export_outlier_trends.csv        | Transaction Amount | 20%       |
| bank_export_outlier_trends.xlsx       | Account Balance    | 15%       |
@edge_cases @outlier_detection @performance
Scenario Outline: Test system performance when processing large datasets with outliers
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to process a dataset containing more than "<row_count>" transactions with outliers
	Then the system should handle the data efficiently
		And processing time should be logged for benchmarking
		And flagged outliers should be included in the anomaly report
Examples:
| file_name                                      | row_count |
| bank_export_large_outlier_dataset.csv        | 100000    |
| bank_export_large_outlier_dataset.xlsx       | 200000    |
