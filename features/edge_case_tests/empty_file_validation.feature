Feature: Handle Edge Cases in Export Files
@edge_cases @empty_files @validation
Scenario Outline: Validate handling of empty export files
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then the system should detect it as empty
		And an appropriate error message should be returned
		And the file should be excluded from processing
		And a system log entry should be recorded for tracking
Examples:
| file_name                          |
| bank_export_empty_file.csv         |
| bank_export_empty_file.xlsx        |
@edge_cases @empty_files @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure system stability when processing multiple empty files
	Given a batch of bank export files:
| file_name                          |
| <file_1>                           |
| <file_2>                           |
| <file_3>                           |
	When I attempt to process these files
	Then the system should continue processing non-empty files
		And an appropriate error should be logged for each empty file
		And system resources should remain stable
Examples:
| file_1                              | file_2                              | file_3                              |
| bank_export_empty_file_1.csv       | bank_export_empty_file_2.csv       | bank_export_empty_file_3.csv       |
| bank_export_empty_file_1.xlsx      | bank_export_empty_file_2.xlsx      | bank_export_empty_file_3.xlsx      |
@edge_cases @empty_files @large_files @performance
Scenario Outline: Validate system performance when processing a mix of empty and large files
	Given a batch of bank export files including empty and large datasets:
| file_name                          |
| <large_file>                       |
| <empty_file>                       |
	When I attempt to process these files
	Then the system should handle large files efficiently
		And empty files should be detected and excluded
		And system memory consumption should remain within acceptable limits
		And processing time should be logged for benchmarking
Examples:
| large_file                          | empty_file                          |
| bank_export_large_dataset.csv      | bank_export_empty_file.csv         |
| bank_export_large_dataset.xlsx     | bank_export_empty_file.xlsx        |
@edge_cases @empty_files @error_reporting @user_notification
Scenario Outline: Ensure user is notified about empty files
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then the user should receive a warning notification about the empty file
		And the file should be marked as failed in the processing log
		And a recommendation should be provided to verify data source
Examples:
| file_name                          |
| bank_export_empty_file.csv         |
| bank_export_empty_file.xlsx        |
