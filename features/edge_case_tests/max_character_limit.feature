Feature: Handle Edge Cases in Export Files
@edge_cases @empty_files @validation
Scenario Outline: Validate handling of empty export files
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then the system should detect it as empty
		And an appropriate error message should be returned
		And the file should be excluded from processing
		And a system log entry should be recorded for tracking
Examples:
| file_name                          |
| bank_export_empty_file.csv         |
| bank_export_empty_file.xlsx        |
@edge_cases @empty_files @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure system stability when processing multiple empty files
	Given a batch of bank export files:
| file_name                          |
| <file_1>                           |
| <file_2>                           |
| <file_3>                           |
	When I attempt to process these files
	Then the system should continue processing non-empty files
		And an appropriate error should be logged for each empty file
		And system resources should remain stable
Examples:
| file_1                              | file_2                              | file_3                              |
| bank_export_empty_file_1.csv       | bank_export_empty_file_2.csv       | bank_export_empty_file_3.csv       |
| bank_export_empty_file_1.xlsx      | bank_export_empty_file_2.xlsx      | bank_export_empty_file_3.xlsx      |
@edge_cases @empty_files @large_files @performance
Scenario Outline: Validate system performance when processing a mix of empty and large files
	Given a batch of bank export files including empty and large datasets:
| file_name                          |
| <large_file>                       |
| <empty_file>                       |
	When I attempt to process these files
	Then the system should handle large files efficiently
		And empty files should be detected and excluded
		And system memory consumption should remain within acceptable limits
		And processing time should be logged for benchmarking
Examples:
| large_file                          | empty_file                          |
| bank_export_large_dataset.csv      | bank_export_empty_file.csv         |
| bank_export_large_dataset.xlsx     | bank_export_empty_file.xlsx        |
@edge_cases @empty_files @error_reporting @user_notification
Scenario Outline: Ensure user is notified about empty files
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then the user should receive a warning notification about the empty file
		And the file should be marked as failed in the processing log
		And a recommendation should be provided to verify data source
Examples:
| file_name                          |
| bank_export_empty_file.csv         |
| bank_export_empty_file.xlsx        |
@edge_cases @hidden_rows @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Detect hidden rows in export files
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for hidden rows in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then all hidden rows should be identified and logged
		And a report should be generated listing the hidden rows
		And users should be alerted to review the hidden data
Examples:
| file_name                          | sheet_name |
| bank_export_hidden_rows.csv        | N/A        |
| bank_export_hidden_rows.xlsx       | Sheet1     |
@edge_cases @hidden_rows @fraud_detection
Scenario Outline: Identify hidden rows with suspicious transactions
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for hidden rows in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then transactions hidden in rows should be flagged as potential fraud
		And flagged transactions should be escalated for further review
		And an alert should be generated for compliance teams
Examples:
| file_name                               | sheet_name |
| bank_export_suspicious_hidden_rows.csv | N/A        |
| bank_export_suspicious_hidden_rows.xlsx | Sheet1     |
@edge_cases @hidden_rows @data_quality
Scenario Outline: Detect and validate partially hidden rows
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check for partially hidden rows in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then rows with partially hidden content should be identified
		And a warning should be generated for data review
		And a suggestion should be provided to adjust visibility settings
Examples:
| file_name                                   | sheet_name |
| bank_export_partial_hidden_rows.csv       | N/A        |
| bank_export_partial_hidden_rows.xlsx      | Sheet1     |
@edge_cases @max_character_limit @data_validation
Scenario Outline: Validate maximum character limit enforcement in data fields
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the "<column_name>" column in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then values exceeding the maximum character limit should be flagged
		And an error log should be generated listing the violations
		And a recommendation should be provided to truncate or correct the data
Examples:
| file_name                          | column_name          | sheet_name |
| bank_export_max_characters.csv     | Account Name         | N/A        |
| bank_export_max_characters.xlsx    | Transaction Details  | Sheet1     |
@edge_cases @max_character_limit @large_files @performance
Scenario Outline: Test system performance when processing fields near character limits
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to process a file containing fields near the max character limit
	Then the system should process the file without performance degradation
		And response times should be logged for benchmarking
		And any truncated values should be flagged for manual review
Examples:
| file_name                              |
| bank_export_large_max_characters.csv  |
| bank_export_large_max_characters.xlsx |
