Feature: Handle Edge Cases in Export Files
@edge_cases @empty_files @validation
Scenario Outline: Validate handling of empty export files
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then the system should detect it as empty
		And an appropriate error message should be returned
		And the file should be excluded from processing
		And a system log entry should be recorded for tracking
Examples:
| file_name                          |
| bank_export_empty_file.csv         |
| bank_export_empty_file.xlsx        |
@edge_cases @empty_files @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure system stability when processing multiple empty files
	Given a batch of bank export files:
| file_name                          |
| <file_1>                           |
| <file_2>                           |
| <file_3>                           |
	When I attempt to process these files
	Then the system should continue processing non-empty files
		And an appropriate error should be logged for each empty file
		And system resources should remain stable
Examples:
| file_1                              | file_2                              | file_3                              |
| bank_export_empty_file_1.csv       | bank_export_empty_file_2.csv       | bank_export_empty_file_3.csv       |
| bank_export_empty_file_1.xlsx      | bank_export_empty_file_2.xlsx      | bank_export_empty_file_3.xlsx      |
@edge_cases @null_values @data_validation
Scenario Outline: Detect missing values in critical fields
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check the "<column_name>" column in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then records with missing values should be flagged
		And a report should be generated listing the affected rows
		And a recommendation should be provided for data correction
Examples:
| file_name                          | column_name          | sheet_name |
| bank_export_null_values.csv        | Transaction Amount   | N/A        |
| bank_export_null_values.xlsx       | Account Holder Name  | Sheet1     |
@edge_cases @null_values @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure system stability when processing files with missing values
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to process records with missing values in the "<column_name>" column
	Then the system should continue processing valid records
		And invalid records should be flagged for manual review
		And an error log should be generated listing affected transactions
Examples:
| file_name                              | column_name        |
| bank_export_null_values_transactions.csv  | Transaction Date   |
| bank_export_null_values_transactions.xlsx | Transaction Amount |
@edge_cases @null_values @performance
Scenario Outline: Test system performance when handling large files with missing values
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I attempt to process a file with more than 100,000 rows and missing values
	Then the system should handle the data efficiently
		And processing time should be logged for benchmarking
		And flagged missing values should be included in the validation report
Examples:
| file_name                                  |
| bank_export_large_null_values.csv         |
| bank_export_large_null_values.xlsx        |
@edge_cases @null_values @data_quality @threshold
Scenario Outline: Define acceptable thresholds for missing values
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I analyze the percentage of missing values in the "<column_name>" column
	Then if missing values exceed "<threshold>%", an alert should be generated
		And transactions above the threshold should be marked for review
		And corrective action should be recommended based on data quality standards
Examples:
| file_name                              | column_name        | threshold |
| bank_export_null_values_threshold.csv  | Transaction ID     | 5%        |
| bank_export_null_values_threshold.xlsx | Account Number     | 10%       |
@edge_cases @null_values @fraud_detection
Scenario Outline: Detect fraudulent patterns in missing value occurrences
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I check missing values in high-risk transaction fields in the "<sheet_name>" sheet
	Then transactions with strategic missing data should be flagged as suspicious
		And flagged cases should trigger an alert for compliance review
		And a fraud report should be generated for further investigation
Examples:
| file_name                                       | sheet_name |
| bank_export_high_risk_null_values.csv         | N/A        |
| bank_export_high_risk_null_values.xlsx        | Sheet1     |
