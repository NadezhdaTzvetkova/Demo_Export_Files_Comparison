Feature: Evaluate System Memory Usage Performance in Export File Processing
@performance_tests @memory_usage @stress_testing
Scenario Outline: Validate memory consumption during file processing
	Given a bank export file containing "<row_count>" rows and "<column_count>" columns
	When the system processes the file
	Then memory consumption should not exceed "<memory_limit>%"
		And processing should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And no memory leaks should occur
Examples:
| row_count  | column_count | memory_limit | expected_time |
| 1,000,000 | 50           | 70          | 60            |
| 5,000,000 | 100          | 85          | 180           |
@performance_tests @memory_usage @database_performance
Scenario Outline: Evaluate database memory usage under large data imports
	Given a bank export file containing "<row_count>" rows
	When I attempt to import the file into the database
	Then database memory consumption should not exceed "<memory_limit>%"
		And indexing operations should not degrade performance
		And no memory-related failures should occur
Examples:
| row_count  | memory_limit |
| 1,000,000 | 75          |
| 10,000,000| 90          |
@performance_tests @memory_usage @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Validate memory efficiency in batch file processing
	Given "<batch_count>" bank export files each containing "<row_count>" rows
	When I process these files in parallel
	Then total memory consumption should remain below "<memory_limit>%"
		And batch failures should be retried up to "<retry_count>" times
		And memory should be released properly after processing
Examples:
| batch_count | row_count  | memory_limit | retry_count |
| 10         | 1,000,000  | 70          | 3           |
| 50         | 500,000    | 80          | 5           |
@performance_tests @memory_usage @long_running
Scenario Outline: Evaluate memory stability for long-running processes
	Given a continuous stream of bank export files arriving every "<interval>" seconds with "<row_count>" rows each
	When the system processes them for "<duration>" hours
	Then memory usage should not increase unexpectedly
		And garbage collection should work effectively
		And processing speed should remain stable over time
Examples:
| interval | row_count  | duration |
| 10       | 1,000,000  | 6        |
| 30       | 5,000,000  | 12       |
@performance_tests @memory_usage @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure proper error handling when memory limits are reached
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" that exceeds memory limits
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then the system should log memory exhaustion errors
		And an appropriate warning should be issued to the user
		And system operations should continue without crashing
Examples:
| file_name                            |
| bank_export_memory_overflow.csv     |
| bank_export_memory_overflow.xlsx    |
@performance_tests @memory_usage @query_performance
Scenario Outline: Evaluate query performance and memory usage on large datasets
	Given a database containing "<row_count>" records from bank export files
	When I execute a complex query with multiple joins and filters
	Then memory consumption should not exceed "<memory_limit>%"
		And query execution should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And results should be returned correctly without system crashes
Examples:
| row_count  | memory_limit | expected_time |
| 10,000,000 | 80          | 5             |
| 50,000,000 | 90          | 15            |
