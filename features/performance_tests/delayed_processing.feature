Feature: Evaluate Performance of Delayed Processing in Export Files
@performance_tests @delayed_processing @latency_testing
Scenario Outline: Validate system behavior under delayed processing conditions
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" with a "<delay_time>" second delay
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then the system should log the delay and continue processing
		And delayed transactions should be flagged for review
		And system stability should not be affected
		And a warning should be issued if the delay exceeds "<max_threshold>" seconds
Examples:
| file_name                           | delay_time | max_threshold |
| bank_export_delayed_processing.csv  | 30         | 60            |
| bank_export_delayed_processing.xlsx | 60         | 120           |
@performance_tests @delayed_processing @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate system behavior with delayed batch file processing
	Given a batch of bank export files processed in "<batch_interval>" seconds
	When I attempt to process them
	Then the system should handle the delay without skipping records
		And the data consistency should be maintained
		And logs should capture batch processing timestamps
		And batch failures should be retried up to "<retry_count>" times
Examples:
| batch_interval | retry_count |
| 120           | 3           |
| 300           | 5           |
@performance_tests @delayed_processing @network_latency
Scenario Outline: Simulate processing delays due to network latency
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" with simulated network latency of "<latency>" ms
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then the system should retry within an acceptable time frame
		And transactions should not be duplicated due to retries
		And an alert should be generated for excessive latency
		And a fallback mechanism should trigger if latency exceeds "<latency_threshold>" ms
Examples:
| file_name                               | latency | latency_threshold |
| bank_export_network_latency.csv        | 500     | 1000              |
| bank_export_network_latency.xlsx       | 1000    | 2000              |
@performance_tests @delayed_processing @long_running
Scenario Outline: Test system stability for long-running delayed processes
	Given a continuous stream of bank export files arriving every "<interval>" seconds with a "<delay_time>" second delay
	When the system processes them for "<duration>" hours
	Then it should maintain stable performance without crashes
		And no memory leaks should occur
		And performance degradation should be minimal
		And log files should capture long-term trends
Examples:
| interval | delay_time | duration |
| 10       | 60         | 6        |
| 30       | 120        | 12       |
@performance_tests @delayed_processing @high_load
Scenario Outline: Stress test delayed processing under high load
	Given a queue of "<file_count>" delayed bank export files
	When I attempt to process them with "<worker_threads>" concurrent threads
	Then the system should efficiently process all files without excessive queue backlog
		And system CPU and memory usage should remain within defined limits
		And delayed files should be prioritized based on "<priority_rule>"
Examples:
| file_count | worker_threads | priority_rule |
| 100        | 5              | FIFO          |
| 500        | 10             | Priority-based|
@performance_tests @delayed_processing @data_integrity
Scenario Outline: Ensure delayed transactions maintain data integrity
	Given a delayed bank export file "<file_name>"
	When I process the file with a delay of "<delay_time>" seconds
	Then all transactions should retain their original timestamps
		And no data should be lost or duplicated due to delays
		And a reconciliation report should be generated
Examples:
| file_name                               | delay_time |
| bank_export_delayed_data_integrity.csv | 45         |
| bank_export_delayed_data_integrity.xlsx| 90         |
