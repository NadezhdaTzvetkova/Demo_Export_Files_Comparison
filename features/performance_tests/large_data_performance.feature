Feature: Evaluate Performance of Large Data Processing in Export Files
@performance_tests @large_data @stress_testing
Scenario Outline: Validate system behavior under large data load
	Given a bank export file with "<row_count>" rows and "<column_count>" columns
	When the system processes the file
	Then processing should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And no data loss or corruption should occur
		And memory consumption should not exceed "<memory_limit>%"
Examples:
| row_count  | column_count | expected_time | memory_limit |
| 1,000,000 | 50           | 60           | 70          |
| 5,000,000 | 100          | 180          | 85          |
@performance_tests @large_data @database_scalability
Scenario Outline: Evaluate database performance under large data imports
	Given a bank export file with "<row_count>" rows
	When I attempt to import the file into the database
	Then the database should complete the import within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And indexing operations should not cause performance degradation
		And no transaction failures should occur
Examples:
| row_count  | expected_time |
| 1,000,000 | 120           |
| 10,000,000| 300           |
@performance_tests @large_data @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate system behavior with large batch file processing
	Given "<batch_count>" bank export files each containing "<row_count>" rows
	When I process these files in parallel
	Then all files should be processed successfully within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And batch failures should be retried up to "<retry_count>" times
		And no out-of-memory errors should occur
Examples:
| batch_count | row_count  | expected_time | retry_count |
| 10         | 1,000,000  | 300           | 3           |
| 50         | 500,000    | 900           | 5           |
@performance_tests @large_data @network_latency
Scenario Outline: Simulate processing delays due to network latency on large files
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" with "<row_count>" rows and simulated network latency of "<latency>" ms
	When I attempt to process the file remotely
	Then the system should retry within an acceptable time frame
		And an alert should be generated if latency exceeds "<latency_threshold>" ms
		And processing should not hang indefinitely
Examples:
| file_name                           | row_count  | latency | latency_threshold |
| bank_export_large_latency.csv      | 1,000,000  | 500     | 1000              |
| bank_export_large_latency.xlsx     | 5,000,000  | 1000    | 2000              |
@performance_tests @large_data @long_running
Scenario Outline: Test system stability for long-running large data processes
	Given a continuous stream of bank export files arriving every "<interval>" seconds with "<row_count>" rows each
	When the system processes them for "<duration>" hours
	Then it should maintain stable performance without crashes
		And memory leaks should not occur
		And processing speed should not degrade significantly over time
Examples:
| interval | row_count  | duration |
| 10       | 1,000,000  | 6        |
| 30       | 5,000,000  | 12       |
@performance_tests @large_data @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure proper error handling during large data processing
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" containing "<error_type>" errors in "<error_percentage>%" of rows
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then the system should log all errors correctly
		And processing should continue without failure for valid rows
		And a summary report should be generated with error statistics
Examples:
| file_name                           | error_type        | error_percentage |
| bank_export_large_data_errors.csv  | Missing Values    | 5                |
| bank_export_large_data_errors.xlsx | Invalid Formats   | 10               |
@performance_tests @large_data @query_performance
Scenario Outline: Evaluate query performance on large datasets
	Given a database containing "<row_count>" records from bank export files
	When I execute a complex query with multiple joins and filters
	Then query execution should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And indexes should be properly utilized
		And query results should match expected values
Examples:
| row_count  | expected_time |
| 10,000,000 | 5             |
| 50,000,000 | 15            |
