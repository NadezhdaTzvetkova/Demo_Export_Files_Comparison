Feature: Evaluate Performance of Concurrent Processing in Export Files
@performance_tests @concurrent_processing @stress_testing
Scenario Outline: Validate concurrent processing of multiple export files
	Given a set of bank export files:
| file_name |
| <file_1>  |
| <file_2>  |
| <file_3>  |
	When I process these files concurrently
	Then the system should process them in parallel without errors
		And processing time should be within acceptable limits
		And no data loss or corruption should occur
		And logs should correctly record processing order
Examples:
| file_1                             | file_2                             | file_3                             |
| bank_export_large_dataset_1.csv    | bank_export_large_dataset_2.csv    | bank_export_large_dataset_3.csv    |
| bank_export_large_dataset_1.xlsx   | bank_export_large_dataset_2.xlsx   | bank_export_large_dataset_3.xlsx   |
@performance_tests @concurrent_processing @high_load
Scenario Outline: Test system performance under high concurrent load
	Given a batch of "<file_count>" bank export files
	When I attempt to process them concurrently with "<threads>" worker threads
	Then the system should complete processing within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And no unexpected failures should occur
		And CPU and memory usage should remain within acceptable limits
		And a summary report should be generated
Examples:
| file_count | threads | expected_time |
| 100        | 5       | 60           |
| 500        | 10      | 180          |
@performance_tests @concurrent_processing @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Validate error handling in concurrent file processing
	Given a mix of valid and corrupt bank export files:
| file_name                         |
| <valid_file>                      |
| <corrupt_file>                    |
	When I process these files concurrently
	Then valid files should be processed successfully
		And corrupt files should be flagged with appropriate error messages
		And no valid transactions should be lost due to errors
		And a detailed error log should be generated
Examples:
| valid_file                            | corrupt_file                         |
| bank_export_valid_data.csv            | bank_export_corrupt_data.csv         |
| bank_export_valid_data.xlsx           | bank_export_corrupt_data.xlsx        |
@performance_tests @concurrent_processing @scalability
Scenario Outline: Evaluate system scalability for concurrent file processing
	Given a bank export workload of "<transaction_count>" transactions across "<file_count>" files
	When I process these files concurrently using "<threads>" worker threads
	Then processing should scale linearly with the number of files
		And system response time should not degrade significantly
		And detailed system metrics should be collected for analysis
Examples:
| transaction_count | file_count | threads |
| 1,000,000        | 100        | 5       |
| 5,000,000        | 500        | 10      |
@performance_tests @concurrent_processing @multi_user
Scenario Outline: Simulate multi-user concurrent processing
	Given "<user_count>" users uploading bank export files simultaneously
	When I monitor system resource utilization
	Then the system should efficiently manage multiple concurrent file uploads
		And no user should experience significant delays
		And all processed data should be stored accurately
Examples:
| user_count |
| 10        |
| 50        |
| 100       |
@performance_tests @concurrent_processing @long_running
Scenario Outline: Test system stability for long-running concurrent processes
	Given a continuous stream of bank export files arriving every "<interval>" seconds
	When the system processes them for "<duration>" hours
	Then it should maintain stable performance without crashes
		And no memory leaks should occur
		And performance degradation should be minimal
		And log files should capture long-term trends
Examples:
| interval | duration |
| 10       | 6        |
| 30       | 12       |
