Feature: Evaluate Performance of Large Transaction Volume Processing in Export Files
@performance_tests @large_transactions @stress_testing
Scenario Outline: Validate system behavior under large transaction volumes
	Given a bank export file containing "<transaction_count>" transactions
	When the system processes the file
	Then processing should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And system memory consumption should not exceed "<memory_limit>%"
		And the system should not crash or hang
Examples:
| transaction_count | expected_time | memory_limit |
| 1,000,000        | 60           | 70          |
| 5,000,000        | 180          | 85          |
@performance_tests @large_transactions @database_performance
Scenario Outline: Evaluate database performance under large transaction imports
	Given a bank export file containing "<transaction_count>" transactions
	When I attempt to import the file into the database
	Then the database should complete the import within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And indexing operations should not slow down the system
		And no transaction failures should occur due to overload
Examples:
| transaction_count | expected_time |
| 1,000,000        | 120           |
| 10,000,000       | 300           |
@performance_tests @large_transactions @batch_processing
Scenario Outline: Evaluate system behavior with large batch transaction processing
	Given "<batch_count>" bank export files each containing "<transaction_count>" transactions
	When I process these files in parallel
	Then all transactions should be processed within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And no out-of-memory errors should occur
		And batch failures should be retried up to "<retry_count>" times
Examples:
| batch_count | transaction_count | expected_time | retry_count |
| 10         | 1,000,000         | 300           | 3           |
| 50         | 500,000           | 900           | 5           |
@performance_tests @large_transactions @network_latency
Scenario Outline: Simulate network latency effects on large transaction volumes
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" with "<transaction_count>" transactions and simulated network latency of "<latency>" ms
	When I attempt to process the file remotely
	Then the system should retry within an acceptable time frame
		And an alert should be generated if latency exceeds "<latency_threshold>" ms
		And processing should not hang indefinitely
Examples:
| file_name                               | transaction_count | latency | latency_threshold |
| bank_export_large_transactions.csv     | 1,000,000        | 500     | 1000              |
| bank_export_large_transactions.xlsx    | 5,000,000        | 1000    | 2000              |
@performance_tests @large_transactions @long_running
Scenario Outline: Test system stability for long-running high-volume transactions
	Given a continuous stream of bank export files arriving every "<interval>" seconds with "<transaction_count>" transactions each
	When the system processes them for "<duration>" hours
	Then it should maintain stable performance without crashes
		And processing speed should not degrade significantly over time
Examples:
| interval | transaction_count | duration |
| 10       | 1,000,000         | 6        |
| 30       | 5,000,000         | 12       |
@performance_tests @large_transactions @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure proper error handling during high-volume transaction processing
	Given a bank export file "<file_name>" containing "<error_type>" errors in "<error_percentage>%" of transactions
	When I attempt to process the file
	Then the system should log all errors correctly
		And processing should continue without failure for valid transactions
		And a summary report should be generated with error statistics
Examples:
| file_name                               | error_type        | error_percentage |
| bank_export_large_transaction_errors.csv | Missing Values    | 5                |
| bank_export_large_transaction_errors.xlsx| Invalid Formats   | 10               |
@performance_tests @large_transactions @query_performance
Scenario Outline: Evaluate query performance on large transaction datasets
	Given a database containing "<transaction_count>" transactions from bank export files
	When I execute a complex query with multiple joins and filters
	Then query execution should complete within "<expected_time>" seconds
		And indexes should be properly utilized
		And query results should match expected values
Examples:
| transaction_count | expected_time |
| 10,000,000       | 5             |
| 50,000,000       | 15            |
