Feature: Evaluate Performance of High Concurrent Users in Export Processing
@performance_tests @high_concurrent_users @stress_testing
Scenario Outline: Validate system behavior under high concurrent user load
	Given "<user_count>" users accessing the system simultaneously
	When they attempt to upload and process bank export files concurrently
	Then the system should maintain stable performance without degradation
		And response times should remain within "<expected_response_time>" seconds
		And no data inconsistencies should occur due to concurrency issues
Examples:
| user_count | expected_response_time |
| 50        | 2                      |
| 200       | 5                      |
| 500       | 10                     |
@performance_tests @high_concurrent_users @resource_utilization
Scenario Outline: Monitor system resource utilization under high concurrent user load
	Given "<user_count>" users performing simultaneous operations on bank export files
	When system performance metrics are monitored
	Then CPU usage should not exceed "<cpu_limit>%"
		And memory usage should remain below "<memory_limit>%"
		And no resource exhaustion should occur
Examples:
| user_count | cpu_limit | memory_limit |
| 100        | 80        | 70          |
| 500        | 90        | 85          |
@performance_tests @high_concurrent_users @database_scalability
Scenario Outline: Evaluate database performance under high concurrent user transactions
	Given "<user_count>" users executing queries simultaneously
	When transaction logs are analyzed
	Then database response times should be within "<query_response_time>" seconds
		And deadlocks or query failures should not occur
		And the database should scale dynamically to handle increased workload
Examples:
| user_count | query_response_time |
| 100        | 1                   |
| 500        | 3                   |
| 1000       | 5                   |
@performance_tests @high_concurrent_users @queue_management
Scenario Outline: Validate system's request queue management with high concurrent users
	Given "<user_count>" users submitting processing requests
	When the system queues the requests for execution
	Then the queue should not exceed "<max_queue_size>" pending requests
		And prioritization rules should apply based on "<priority_rule>"
		And queue processing efficiency should be logged
Examples:
| user_count | max_queue_size | priority_rule |
| 200        | 50             | FIFO          |
| 500        | 100            | High-Priority |
@performance_tests @high_concurrent_users @error_handling
Scenario Outline: Ensure proper error handling under high concurrent load
	Given "<user_count>" users performing simultaneous operations
	When some operations fail due to system limitations
	Then failures should be logged with clear error messages
		And users should receive appropriate error notifications
		And the system should retry failed requests where applicable
Examples:
| user_count |
| 100       |
| 500       |
| 1000      |
@performance_tests @high_concurrent_users @long_running_stability
Scenario Outline: Test system stability over extended high-load periods
	Given "<user_count>" users continuously accessing the system for "<duration>" hours
	When system health metrics are monitored
	Then memory leaks should not occur
		And CPU and memory utilization should remain stable
		And no crashes or unexpected terminations should happen
Examples:
| user_count | duration |
| 200       | 6        |
| 500       | 12       |
| 1000      | 24       |
